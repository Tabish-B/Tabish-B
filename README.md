## 👋 Hi, I’m Tabish Butt (@Tabish-B)

I’m a **frontend-focused web developer** exploring the intersection of **Web Development, Machine Learning, and NLP**.  
I care about **strong fundamentals, clear logic, and building things I actually understand**.

---

## 👀 Interests
- 🌐 Frontend Web Development
- ⚛️ React (Vite, hooks, component-driven UI)
- 🎨 UI systems & color science (OKLCH, accessibility)
- 🤖 Machine Learning & NLP (applied, not buzzwords)
- 🗣️ Language & dialect processing for low-resource languages

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React (Vite)
- TypeScript (learning)
- Tailwind CSS

**ML / NLP (Foundations)**
- Python
- Text processing & NLP basics
- Phonetics (IPA), script handling
- Basic ML concepts (clustering, data preparation)
- Exploring AI + frontend integration via APIs

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Netlify
- VS Code

---

## 🚀 Projects & Focus

- 🧮 **React Calculator Projects**  
  Learning state, props, and UI logic deeply

- 🎨 **AI-Powered Color Tools**  
  Color extraction, OKLCH conversion, palette harmony  
  (focused on understanding the math, not just using libraries)

- 🗣️ **Dialect & Language Preservation (NLP)**  
  Working with text, phonetics (IPA), and structured linguistic data  
  Interest in low-resource language pipelines

---

## 🧠 How I Learn
- Fundamentals before frameworks
- No “magic” without understanding
- Build → break → fix → document
- Prefer logic and structure over hype

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Make frontend fundamentals permanent
- Build honest, presentable projects
- Combine React with ML/NLP meaningfully
- Move toward explainable AI-powered web apps
